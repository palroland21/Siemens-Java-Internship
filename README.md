Siemens Java Internship - Code Refactoring Project

This project was initially developed by a Siemens team but contained several implementation gaps including incomplete error handling, concurrency issues, and missing validation logic. I significantly improved the codebase by:

 - Fixing critical bugs in the asynchronous processing logic
 - Implementing exception handling throughout the application
 - Adding proper input validation (including email format verification)
 - Refactoring the thread-safe operations using AtomicInteger and synchronized collections
 - Developing a complete suite of JUnit tests with >90% code coverage
 - Correcting all HTTP status codes in the Controller layer
 - Documenting all improvements with clear code comments

The enhanced implementation now properly handles concurrent item processing while maintaining data integrity, provides appropriate error responses, and includes thorough unit tests validating.
